        <div class = "About-Me">
            <p>Outside of learning to become a Full Stack Software Engineer, I spend most of my time with my wife in the gym. My health and my physique are my other full time job. When I'm not in the gym, I'm home playing Call of Duty, Black Myth: Wukong, or any of the games I've downloaded off the Playstation network. I really enjoy comics, although I don't read as much anymore. (Yes, The Hulk is my favorite)</p>
