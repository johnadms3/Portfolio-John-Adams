        <p>Welcome! I am a full stack software engineer. Although I am in the beginning of my journey I have accomplished somethings and will be accomplishing a whole lot more. This is my Living Portfolio, I will be updating this often with more of my proudest projects as I complete them. Scroll down and get a peek at my work and get a little insight into John's world.<br><br>Need to contact me?

        <div class = "About-Me">
            <p>Outside of learning to become a Full Stack Software Engineer, I spend most of my time with my wife in the gym. My health and my physique are my other full time job. When I'm not in the gym, I'm home playing Call of Duty, Black Myth: Wukong, or any of the games I've downloaded off the Playstation network. I really enjoy comics, although I don't read as much anymore. (Yes, The Hulk is my favorite)</p>
